Setup a development environment for Puppet. Target OS is Ubuntu, though it
should be broadly applicable to other type distros too.

The include lxc-centos builds an LXC template for containing a very minimal
CentOS plus sshd and avahi for name resolution.

TODO:

Script to configure LXC environment (or other VM) post bootstrap via SSH (e.g.
Fabric). This then pulls in yum.puppetlabs.com configuration, sets up yum repo
and installs puppet, emulating a live situation. 

Prereq is that their is a route to root via SSH and sudo using a known
username.

If this is root + password: 
 - Create new user, assign password, grant sudo access, install ssh pub key

If this is other user + password + sudo + password:
 - install ssh pub key

If this is other user + ssh key + sudo + password:
 - This is okay. next step
